scpos

NAME
    scpos - secure copy extended

SYNOPSIS
    scpos [-h] | [-r] get | post IP:file

DESCRIPTION
    scpos is used to transfer file(s) from one machine to another securely. It is a clone of scp but does not use SSH under the hood. Instead, a custom encryption/decryption algorithm is used to secure data. The additional functionality provided is a way of excluding certain files while transfering a folder. SSH authentication is not required as the protocol used for file transfer is TCP.

    The first argument is the source while the second argument is the destination. If the IP address is specified with a port, the source/destination is remote.

    The options are as follows:

    -h      To display this help menu
    -r      To send a folder recursively

HISTORY
    Based on scp by Timo Rinne <tri@iki.fi> and Timo Rinne <tri@iki.fi> and rsync originally by Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras.
